      <description>HUGO XMIN Keep it simple, but not simpler XMin is a Hugo theme written by Yihui Xie in about four hours: half an hour was spent on the Hugo templates, and 3.5 hours were spent on styling. The main motivation for writing this theme was to provide a really minimal example to beginners of Hugo templates. This XMin theme contains about 140 lines of code in total, including the code in HTML templates and CSS (also counting empty lines).</description>
